We are primarily a text-based service and NLP is at the core of our ML work. With recent advances in large language models, we are seeing a tremendous acceleration in capabilities. A non-trivial part of our work involves appropriately leveraging and building on top of these models thoughtfully (and with scaffolding) to our use cases and backing them up with a sound automated evaluation. In addition, we use the in-house deidentified data as robust feedback data for continuously improving the ML models.  We are excellent collaborators, within our team and across teams with product owners, engineers, and clinicians to deliver automated products for doctors and patients. A successful candidate will own and help engineer end-to-end, AI/ML-powered automated systems in service of better health outcomes at lower costs.

"Los Angeles, CA",Machine Learning Engineer,$130K - $150K (Employer est.),Keeling Labs,"About Keeling Labs Who We Are: We’re an applied ML research company squarely focused on solving climate change. We recently closed a $1.5M seed round We’re backed by Y Combinator (W23) Our founder previously started the Battery Data Science Team at Rivian What We’re Building: We’re optimizing how large batteries in the grid buy and sell energy so that the grid can run on more renewables. To do this, we’re developing self-optimizing, self-adapting systems using reinforcement learning. You can learn more about how our code directly impacts the grid in our blog post here Why It Matters: As the grid increasingly shifts to renewable energy from wind and solar, more and more large battery systems are needed to store that energy for times when there’s huge demand for energy but not enough supply. As a society, we have all the physical battery technology needed to do this, but the software technology that figures out when and how to optimally use the battery is still in its infancy. There’s going to be a 15x increase in these large batteries by 2030, and they’re currently growing at 50% YoY. As the grid is fundamentally altered by the addition of these batteries, we need to ensure that we’re utilizing all of them to their full potential.

"New York, NY",Machine Learning Engineer,$130K (Employer est.),Ntropy Network,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.  One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.  We - come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts. - are allergic to over-engineering. - are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo. love playing board and video games. - are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results. - are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool.
